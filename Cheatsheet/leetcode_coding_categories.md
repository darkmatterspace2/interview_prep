This is a comprehensive list of the core building blocks for computer science and competitive programming. To make this manageable, I’ve grouped them into logical categories based on how they are typically applied.

## 1. Core Data Structures

These categories focus on how data is organized and accessed.

* **String:** Problems involving text manipulation, such as checking for palindromes or reversing words.
* **Hash Table / Hash Function:** Using Key-Value pairs for  lookup. Essential for frequency counting or finding duplicates.
* **Linked List / Doubly-Linked List:** Sequential data structures where elements point to the next (and previous).
* **Stack / Queue:** Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structures.
* **Tree / Binary Tree / Binary Search Tree (BST):** Hierarchical structures. BSTs keep data sorted for fast search/insertion.
* **Heap (Priority Queue):** Automatically keeps the smallest or largest element at the top.
* **Trie:** A "Prefix Tree" used for efficient string searches (like autocomplete).
* **Design / Iterator:** Building your own data structures (e.g., "Design a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache").

## 2. Fundamental Algorithms & Techniques

These are the "how-to" methods for solving problems.

* **Sorting:** Arranging data (Merge Sort, Quickselect, Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort).
* **Two Pointers:** Using two indices to traverse an array (often from both ends) to find a pair or range.
* **Sliding Window:** A sub-segment of an array that "slides" to find a specific range (e.g., longest substring without repeating characters).
* **Prefix Sum:** Pre-calculating sums of array segments to answer range sum queries in .
* **Recursion:** A function calling itself to solve smaller versions of the same problem.
* **Divide and Conquer:** Breaking a problem into two halves, solving them, and merging (like Merge Sort).
* **Binary Search:** Searching a **sorted** range by repeatedly halving the search area.

## 3. Optimization & Decision Making

These are the heavy hitters for finding the "best" or "most efficient" solution.

* **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Breaking a problem into overlapping subproblems and storing results (Memoization).
* **Greedy:** Making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum.
* **Backtracking:** "Trial and error" approach. If a path doesn't work, you go back and try a different one (e.g., Sudoku solvers).
* **Bitmask DP:** Using bits (0s and 1s) to represent states in DP, often for "subset" problems.

## 4. Graph & Advanced Search

Used when data is interconnected (like social networks or maps).

* **Depth-First Search (DFS) / Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The two primary ways to traverse graphs and trees.
* **Graph Theory:** General problems involving nodes and edges.
* **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union):** Tracking elements split into non-overlapping sets; great for detecting cycles.
* **Shortest Path:** Finding the quickest route between nodes (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford).
* **Topological Sort:** Ordering tasks that have dependencies (e.g., "Course Schedule").
* **Minimum Spanning Tree:** Connecting all nodes with the minimum total edge weight.
* **Strongly Connected Components:** Groups of nodes where every node is reachable from every other node in the group.

## 5. Mathematical & Specialized Topics

* **Math / Number Theory:** Problems involving primes, GCD, or modular arithmetic.
* **Combinatorics / Probability and Statistics:** Counting permutations, combinations, or calculating odds.
* **Geometry:** Problems involving points, lines, and shapes in a 2D/3D plane.
* **Bit Manipulation:** Using bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`) to solve problems with high performance.
* **Segment Tree / Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree):** Advanced structures for frequent range updates and queries.
* **Game Theory:** Problems involving "optimal play" between two players (e.g., Nim game).
* **Brainteaser:** Problems that require a "Eureka!" moment or a clever trick rather than a standard algorithm.

## 6. System & Miscellaneous

* **Database:** SQL-based queries.
* **Concurrency:** Handling multiple threads/tasks simultaneously.
* **Data Stream:** Processing data that arrives one by one, where you can't store everything.
* **Shell:** Problems involving Bash/Terminal scripting.
