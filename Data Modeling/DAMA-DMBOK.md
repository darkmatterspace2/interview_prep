# DAMA-DMBOK (Data Management Body of Knowledge)

The **DAMA-DMBOK** is a comprehensive framework dedicated to Data Management. It provides a standard view of the functions of data management and usually visualizes them using the **DAMA Wheel**.

## The DAMA Wheel

The DAMA Wheel places **Data Governance** at the center, signifying that governance provides the direction and oversight for all other data management functions. Surrounding the center are the 10 other Knowledge Areas.
