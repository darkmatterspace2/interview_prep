For me, the OA had 3-4 sections.
I got the link around 5 days back.

1st section :-
2 coding questions on HackerRank
Topics were mainly prefix sum / sliding window / hashmap, but the wording was a bit tricky and had some math-style reasoning.

Q1 felt Medium (Easy–Medium)
Q2 was Medium–Hard — I couldn’t complete it fully.

2nd section :-
Email-writing task based on Amazon Leadership Principles

A short section like How would you rate yourself as an engineer?
