Hello guys,
so the recruiter called me after applying on the carrers page.

Gave me 25 days for the interview prep. They said the interview pattern has changed and now you will be having a DSA round and Googlyness round on the same day itself first and then if you pass those you will have 2 inperson onsite rounds. Coding language was Python.

However I failed in the first rounds itself. DSA round experience was not good as the interviewer was unable to speak english very well. It took me 20-25 mins just to understand the question and what makes the string special.

Here's my experience.

# Round 1 (DSA Round):
The interviewer first asked me about my current company and what I do at my current job.

You are giving a string s, write a function that returns true or false. True, meaning the string is special and false meaning the string is not special.

A string is special if it's length >= 3 and all it's subsequences are in the dictionary. Dictionary is provided along with the string to the function parameter

Clarifying questions asked:
🔴What is the maximum length of the string?
🔵10

🔴Will the string have spaces or anything that needs to be taken care of other than chars.
🔵No.

🔴What if the string with length < 3 is provided.
🔵It is automatically a special string. No need to check in the dictionary.

I went on to say that this is a backtracking question and started to code it up. At this point 25 minutes have already been passed.

Then I coded it up and he asked me the time complexity and I messed this up. Instead of O(2 
n
 ) I said O(N!) which was completely wrong.

I found this out later after the interview ended. Felt very bad after finding it out.

Anyways, we move on.

# Round 2 (Googlyness Round):
Major questions were from this itself -> Googlyness FAQs

🔴I was asked about have you worked on project alone like from start to end?
🔴Have you covered up for a senior on some task?
🔴Had an experience where your credit was taken by someone else?
🔴What did you do when you messed up? How did you fix it?
🔴Ever mentored a junior?
🔴How did you resolve a conflict with a senior, what was the conflict and what was the outcome? Who's idea was chosen finally?

Cooldown Period: 12 months. I did tell the HR about the experience and they said nothing can be done, but no worries, I have the satisfaction of cracking it once previously and getting into the team matching phase which I still am in.

I hope this post helps you.
