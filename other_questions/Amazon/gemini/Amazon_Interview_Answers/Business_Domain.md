## Part 1: Business Domain

#### 101. Key KPIs for logistics systems.
**Answer:**
*   **OTD (On-Time Delivery):** % of shipments delivered by the promised date.
*   **CPU (Cost Per Unit):** Total shipping cost / Total units shipped.
*   **Perfect Order Rate:** % of orders on time, complete, undamaged, and with correct documentation.
*   **DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities):** A Six Sigma metric for quality.

#### 102. How data improves delivery efficiency.
**Answer:**
*   **Route Optimization:** Algorithms reduce fuel usage and drive time.
*   **Load Balancing:** Predicting volume allows correct staffing of warehouses (avoiding overtime or idle time).
*   **Predictive Maintenance:** IoT sensors on trucks predict breakdowns before they happen.

#### 103. Cost drivers in transportation.
**Answer:**
*   **Fuel:** Volatile and significant.
*   **Labor:** Drivers, warehouse staff.
*   **Asset Utilization:** A truck driving empty ("deadhead") costs money but earns zero revenue.
*   **Last Mile:** The most expensive part of the chain (stops are frequent and distinct).

#### 104. Metrics to track delivery delays.
**Answer:**
*   **Average Lateness:** (Actual Time - Promised Time).
*   **Miss Rate:** % of items missing the specific SLA cut-off (e.g., Prime 2-day).
*   **Dwell Time:** Time a package sits in a facility without moving.

#### 105. Trade-offs between speed and cost.
**Answer:**
*   **Air vs Ground:** Air is fast but expensive (High CPU). Ground is slow but cheap.
*   **Consolidation:** Waiting to fill a truck lowers cost (economies of scale) but increases delay (lower speed).
*   **Network Design:** Building more warehouses places inventory closer (Speed) but increases inventory holding and facility costs (Cost).
